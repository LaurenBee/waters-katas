SPIN THE WHEEL

Create a wheel spinner that a user can add text to (e.g. names/prizes) and spin to choose a winning section randomly.

- The user can input between 2 and 12 items to go on the wheel
- Each item on the wheel should be sectioned equally
- The background of each section should be a different, solid colour
- The wheel needs a 'pointer' in a fixed position to indicate the result
- The spinning of the wheel should be random; in terms of number of times it spins and which result it lands on
- The winning result should be displayed as an overlayed window

- Optional: Add confetti visual for the winner



A-PET-TURE

Create a UI that allows pet owners to configure their new smart pet flap. 

- The pet flap identifies pets by microchip ID, acceptable microchip number formats are:
    - 15 digit number - e.g. 977200000000000
    - 10 digit number - e.g. 111111112A
    - 9/13 digit number - e.g. AVID*012*345*378
- One pet can only be associated with one microchip ID
- Each pet should have their own named profile where the owner can configure the settings
- A pet should be allowed into the (house) at any time of day
- The times a pet is allowed to leave the (house) is completely configurable by the owner and can consist of up to two time ranges (24hr format)
- The time ranges should update automatically with regional clock shifts e.g. BST

- Optional: allow the owner to display times in a 12hr format
- Optional: allow the owner to upload a picture to the pet's profile
